# Herman Parent Faculty Club — GitHub Pages site (Jekyll)

This repository contains a minimal Jekyll site suitable for GitHub Pages. It includes the following pages:
- Home (index.md)
- About (about.md)
- Programs (programs.md)
- Get Involved (get-involved.md)
- Contact (contact.md)

How to publish
1. Commit these files to the root of your repository (this has been done).
2. Push to GitHub (this has been done).
3. In the repository Settings → Pages, choose the branch (`main` or `gh-pages`) and the root folder (`/`) as the publishing source.
4. Save. GitHub will build and publish the site at `https://<your-user-or-org>.github.io/www` (or your custom domain if configured).

Notes & next steps
- Replace placeholder contact info, bios, and the Formspree action URL in `contact.md`.
- If you want a custom domain, add a `CNAME` file with the domain name and configure DNS.
- If you prefer, I can switch the publishing branch or add a CNAME and configure DNS records if you provide the domain.
